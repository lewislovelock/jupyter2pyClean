# Jupyter Converter Script 🚀

This shell script quickly converts Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) into clean Python scripts (`.py`), removing unnecessary cell notations (`# In[ ]:`) and formatting the code with `black` for a polished final product. Perfect for integrating your Jupyter work into your development projects!

## Prerequisites 📋

Before using the script, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install jupyter nbconvert black
```

## How to Use 🛠️

1. **Download the Script**:
   - Save `jupyter_converter.sh` to your local machine.

2. **Make It Executable**:
   - In your terminal, navigate to the script's directory and run:
  
     ```bash
     chmod +x jupyter_converter.sh
     ```

3. **Convert Your Notebook**:
   - Run the script with your `.ipynb` file:

     ```bash
     ./jupyter_converter.sh <notebook.ipynb>
     ```

   - Example:

     ```bash
     ./jupyter_converter.sh example_notebook.ipynb
     ```

4. **Get Your Cleaned Script**:
   - The output will be a formatted Python file named `example_notebook.py`.

## Example 🧑‍💻

Convert `data_analysis.ipynb` to a Python script:

```bash
./jupyter_converter.sh data_analysis.ipynb
```

You'll find `data_analysis.py` in the same directory, ready to use.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- **`command not found`**: Make sure `jupyter` and `black` are installed and in your PATH.
- **`No such file or directory`**: Ensure the notebook file exists where you specified.
